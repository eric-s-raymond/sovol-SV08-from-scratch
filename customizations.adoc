= Tuning and Customizatuions

If you found this before the link:setup.adoc[Sovol08 Build and Setup Guide],
you should probably read that first.

This is a guide to tuning and improving your Sovol08
after it has passed initial acceptance tests.

Each mod here is intended to be small, self-contained, and
self-explanatory. If you don't undetstnd what it's doing, file an

== Temperature-controlled fan

Early videos on the SV08 were full of complaints about the mainboard
fan being extremely loud. This is no longer a problem on 08s
manufactured in 2025, but it's still a good idea to extend the fan's
lifetime by applying John Hansknecht's CPU fan control mod after
printer.cfg:375 below the fan3 control code:

// batchspell: off
----
[temperature_fan CPUfan]
pin: PA1
kick_start_time: 0.5
max_power: 1.0
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 90
hardware_pwm: true
target_temp: 60
sensor_type: temperature_host
max_speed: 1.0
min_speed: 0
control: pid
pid_Kp: 2     
pid_Ki: .5     
pid_Kd: 0.25     
pid_deriv_time: 5.0
----
// batchspell: on
