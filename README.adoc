// batchspell: add Klipper Patreon Sovol unix SV
= Sovol SV08 From Scratch

This repository contains guides intended to get
a technically inclined person from a cold start
to a fully working and tuned Sovol SV08 3D printer.

It's based on the experiences I had setting mine up.

Unlike some other guides, the governing philosophy
is to stay as close as possible to a stock Sovol
installation and make small, incremental changes
that are easy to understand and combine with
modifications by people who aren't me.

* link:unix-setup.adoc[Tips and help for Linux and *BSD users]

* link:customizations.adoc[Tuning and Customizations]

* link:advice.adoc[Actionable Advice]

Much of the material in the set-up guide is generic to all Klipper
printers, but not all of it. The Actionable Advice is generic.
